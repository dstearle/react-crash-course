<strong>What is this project? :</strong>

- This is just a simple todo list where the user can add/delete items to a list or mark items as completed. I am already very proficient in javascript and another framework called vue.js but wanted to learn about react since it is so popular and also to compare the two in terms of how they work and feel.
