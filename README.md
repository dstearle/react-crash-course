<strong>What is this project? :</strong>

- This is a simple todo list built using the Javascript framework called React. The user can add/delete items to a list or mark items as listed items as completed.

<br>

**What Is React? :**

- React is a Javascript framework just as like Angular and Vue. Like Vue and Angular it is component based and is primarily focused for being used solely for building UI. Where Angular comes packaged with a lot of features React is built as light as possible with the intention that you import in other libraries to fill your needs as you see fit(For instance redux for state management).

**Notes:**

- To run the application use "npm start"
